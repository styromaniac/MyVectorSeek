# SHADE - Superior Hybrid Anti-Aliasing

**In-game FXAA's Perfect Partner**

Where your game's built-in FXAA leaves off, SHADE picks up the challenge. While in-game FXAA excels at quick, broad edge smoothing, it often struggles with diagonal lines, complex curves, and certain texture patterns. SHADE is specifically engineered to complement these limitations, working in harmony with your game's anti-aliasing to deliver exceptional image clarity.

SHADE analyzes problematic edges that traditional FXAA often misses â€“ the staircased diagonals, the jagged curves, and those notorious thin lines that shimmer during movement. With its intelligent multi-scale detection and 48-sample processing, SHADE targets only what needs fixing without the performance impact of expensive techniques like MSAA or TAA.

Optimized specifically for gaming displays, SHADE offers specialized profiles for Steam Deck screens (LCD, OLED BOE, and Samsung OLED LE), intelligently adjusting subpixel rendering to match your exact display technology for maximum clarity. The shader's perspective-aware processing ensures 3D game environments receive context-appropriate smoothing without losing detail.

**Key Advantages When Paired with In-game FXAA:**
- Eliminates remaining diagonal jaggies that in-game FXAA often misses
- Preserves texture detail and small text that FXAA might blur
- Reduces temporal shimmering on thin lines during motion
- Panel-specific optimizations enhance detail clarity on your specific display
- Minimal performance impact compared to higher-level AA techniques

Enable your game's built-in FXAA first, then add SHADE for the finishing touch that transforms good anti-aliasing into great anti-aliasing.
